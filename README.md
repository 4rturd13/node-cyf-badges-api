CFY emblems is an API that seeks to bring together all the people who are part of Code Your Future worldwide: earth_africa :: earth_americas :: earth_asia:

## About the API

Developed in Node JS and launched as an open source api for students to consume the content for their projects by creating different Front-End in any technology.

> Whenever a new Front-End is done we would like to see it working, so we ask that a ** PR ** be sent in the ** Front-End ** section under the format:

| GitHub                                  | CYF City | CYF Country | URL Project | Technology used |
